# TaskFlow

The **TaskFlow** project, when viewed on GitHub, exhibits a clean and modular **React + Vite + TypeScript** architecture. It is designed for scalability and clarity, leveraging modern libraries and tools such as **ShadCN UI**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Redux Toolkit** for state management.

## Project Overview

React/Vite-based architecture. Its core source code resides in the src/ directory, which contains organized folders for reusable components, custom hooks, utility lib, mock data (mocks), feature-specific pages, state management via store, and TypeScript type definitions (types). Key entry points include App.tsx, main.tsx, and index.css. The root also includes standard config files like .gitignore, README.md, vite-env.d.ts, eslint.config.js, and components.json, indicating a modern, typed, and well-configured frontend application built with Vite and likely using React with TypeScript and ShadCN UI components.

## ⚙️ Highlights

* **`src/mocks/`** – Implements a **mocked backend** using *Mock Service Worker (MSW)*, simulating endpoints like `/login`, `/tasks`, and `/tasks/:id`.
* **`src/features/`** – Feature-based folder structure improving modularity.
* **`src/hooks/` & `src/lib/`** – Contain custom hooks and reusable logic.
* **`src/types/`** – Strongly typed interfaces ensuring type safety across the app.
* **`App.tsx`**, **`main.tsx`**, and **`index.css`** – Serve as main entry points for rendering, routing, and global styles.

## Configuration & Tooling

At the root level, configuration files such as `.gitignore`, `eslint.config.js`, and `vite-env.d.ts` showcase adherence to modern TypeScript practices. The inclusion of `components.json` suggests integration with **ShadCN UI**, ensuring reusable and stylistically consistent UI components.

### Summary

The **TaskFlow** project follows a **feature-driven, type-safe, and Vite-optimized** architecture ideal for scalable frontend applications. Its structure balances clarity, modularity, and performance while maintaining strong developer ergonomics with tools like **MSW**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Tailwind CSS**.
